# CIFE (CP/M Image-File Explorer)

The CP/M Image-File Explorer is used to create and edit binary disk images such as those used by CP/M emulators.

The CP/M Image File Explorer is based on the C source code of Michael Haardt's CP/M tools.

CP/M Image-File Explorer is completely rewritten with the Lazarus Free Pascal development environment and replaces the previous C/C++ version with the wxWidgets framework.

The C code of the CP/M tools has also been completely converted to Pascal. At the same time, some small improvements / adjustments have been made.
